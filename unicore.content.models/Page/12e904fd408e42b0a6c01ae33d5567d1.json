Hot weather makes it worse.\r\n\r\nIn pregnancy, your body makes extra blood and can sometimes hold too much fluid. As your baby grows, some of your veins are squeezed. This results in blood being trapped in your legs. The pressure from the trapped blood forces fluid into the skin of your feet and ankles. This fluid would normally be absorbed by your body.\r\n\r\nYou will probably find that the swelling is worse as the day goes on. It will be better in the morning after you've been lying in bed. Try to rest with your feet up for some time during the day. Standing still for long periods can make the swelling worse, so try to sit down to do some jobs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of pregnancy, your hands might start to swell. Your rings may feel tight on your fingers. Wear them on a chain around your neck instead.\r\n\r\n**Danger signs?** If you have sudden swelling or blurred (double) vision, you need to see a bidan fast. This can be a sign of a serious condition that can lead to fits.",
