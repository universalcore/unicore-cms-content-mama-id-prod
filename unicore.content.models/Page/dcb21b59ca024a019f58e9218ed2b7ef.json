Add cashew nuts and peanuts to your food to make it even healthier. Fruits like mangoes, papayas and jackfruits are good. Have lots of green leafy vegetables like boiled papaya leaves, boiled tapioca leaves, pumpkin leaves, kangkung, kale, bokchoi and spinach. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\n 2. **Get check-ups** while you are pregnant. Try to have 4 visits to your bidan. Get your blood and urine tests and blood pressure checks done regularly. These tests help to find problems early. Then you can get treatment and keep yourself and your baby safe. \r\n\r\n 3. **Get tested for HIV if you are worried**. If you are HIV+, there are medicines to help keep you well and prevent your baby from being born HIV+. If you find out you are not HIV+, you can make sure you stay that way.\r\n\r\n 4. **Take your pregnancy tablets**. These tablets help your baby grow well. Ask your bidan if you can get them free. \r\n\r\n 5. **Keep clean**. Wash your hands with soap before cooking and eating and after using the toilet. \r\n",
