The surest sign is a missed period, but you may find it hard to remember the date of your last period.\r\n\r\nDo you have any of these signs of pregnancy?\r\n\r\n - Your breasts look and feel different \r\n - You notice some spots of blood in your underwear \r\n - You feel nauseous\r\n - You need to pass urine more than usual \r\n - You miss a period\r\n\r\nIf you think you are pregnant, it is best if you see a midwife (bidan). The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start planning for your new baby. A bidan will also be able to give you advice and help while you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nThe bidan will weigh you, check your blood pressure and test your urine. \r\n\r\nWorried about seeing a bidan? Ask a friend to go with you.",
